# üìù **Project Explanation: Group Budget Splitter**

---

### 1. **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to build a web application that helps a group of people fairly split shared expenses, such as rent, food, utilities, etc. The app:

* Accepts multiple expense categories with their amounts.
* Accepts the number of people and how much each person has contributed.
* Calculates how much each person *should* pay equally.
* Shows how much each person overpaid or underpaid.
* Provides payback instructions indicating who owes money to whom and how much.

---

### 2. **Technologies Used**

* **Backend:** Python with the Django framework
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
* **Templates:** Django template engine to dynamically render HTML pages
* **Styling:** Custom CSS for professional UI design
* **Data Handling:** Django forms to process user input

---

### 3. **Project Structure**

* `models.py`: Defines data models for `Category`, `Person`, and `Contribution` (though main input is form-based without DB storage in this version).
* `forms.py`: Defines Django forms for categories and persons input.
* `views.py`: Contains the business logic for:

  * Displaying input forms
  * Handling form submissions
  * Performing calculations and payback logic
  * Rendering results.
* `urls.py`: Defines URL routes connecting views.
* `templates/core/`: Contains HTML templates (`home.html` for input and `result.html` for output).
* `static/css/style.css`: Contains the CSS for styling the app.

---

### 4. **How It Works**

* **Input Page (home.html):**
  Users can dynamically add any number of expense categories (e.g., Rent, Food) and persons with the amounts they paid. This is powered by JavaScript to add fields on demand.

* **Calculation (views.py - calculate view):**
  On form submission, the backend:

  1. Totals all category expenses.
  2. Divides total equally among the number of people.
  3. Calculates difference between each person‚Äôs paid amount and their share.
  4. Figures out paybacks ‚Äî who owes whom and how much to balance the expenses.

* **Output Page (result.html):**
  Shows:

  * Breakdown of categories and amounts.
  * Total expense and equal share per person (rounded to 2 decimals for readability).
  * A table listing each person‚Äôs paid amount, should pay amount, and difference.
  * A payback instruction list specifying the minimal transfers needed to settle debts.

### 5. **Key Features and Professional Aspects**

* **Dynamic form fields:** Users can add multiple categories and persons as needed.
* **Clear financial calculations:** Uses Python‚Äôs `Decimal` for precision.
* **Clean, responsive UI:** Simple but professional layout with CSS styling.
* **Decimal formatting:** Outputs financial values rounded to two decimal places for clarity.
* **Extensible architecture:** Modular Django app structure making future enhancements easy.
* **CSRF protection:** Secure form submissions with Django‚Äôs CSRF token.
* **Error handling:** Required fields and input types enforced by HTML and forms.

---

### 6. **Possible Extensions**

* Add user authentication and save budgets for logged-in users.
* Store data persistently using Django models.
* Export results as PDF or Excel.
* Add charts/graphs for visual expense summaries.
* Add multi-currency support.

---

### 7. **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone/download the project.
2. Install dependencies (`Django`).
3. Run migrations (if using models):

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Create a superuser (optional for admin):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser to use the app.

---

### 8. **Summary**

This Django project demonstrates core web development skills, including backend logic, form handling, templating, and frontend dynamic interactions, applied to a practical and useful tool that simplifies group expense sharing with clear and fair calculations.
